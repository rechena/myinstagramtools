# myinstagramtools

## Intro
This is a script that I've done to replace my IFFFT tools. 
It will search for a specific TAG in Instagram, download the image and create a Evernote Note in the default Evernote Notebook. 

### Notes
* For this you'll need: 
	* Evernote API Python:
https://dev.evernote.com/doc/start/python.php
	* Instagram API Python:
https://github.com/facebookarchive/python-instagram
* It will create the Folder defined in the path if does not exists
* It will create the note with the Title from the Instagram till the first # 
* If no title it will create with "Instagram from <tag to search>"

### TODO
* Pick the notebook 
* Cleanup...
* Lots of stuff, this a small, and start script...
